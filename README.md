The simple shell made by me to close off my c learning 

I thought this was a cool project to make so started making it 
<br>
While making it  I figured such type of program are preferred to made on UNIX-like system and not windows but
<br>
I did my research and fair share of Chatgpt i was able to overcome it 
<br>
for the basic understanding and my starting have been : <br>

2>https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ by Stephen Brennan <br>
both of them have great write up about building a shell like this if either of you ever end up seeing this huge thank you for it <br>
apart from the functions they added in their shells in included few more in this one <br>

All the builtin functions you would find this one are:<br>
    cd = change directory <br>
    help =listing all builtin functions <br>
    exit = terminate the shell<br>
    echo = print a message <br>
    clear = clearing the terminal screen<br>
    cwd = printing the current working directory <br>
Apart from all these the technical details can be found in the comments of the code itself <br>
It may not be the most readable code out there but its something for me <br>
Feel free to clone it tell me any optimization bug or improvment needed <br>
thank you
